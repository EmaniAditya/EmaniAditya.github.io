Hi, I'm Aditya — a software developer focused on building scalable web applications with the MERN stack. I care about clean code, minimal design and shipping useful things.

Currently interning at Accenture. I’ve built projects like a full‑stack Blog Platform with authentication, a Front Page Maker (with PDF export), and several small apps.

This site hosts my portfolio and blog. Dark mode supported.
