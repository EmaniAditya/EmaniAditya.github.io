Hi, I'm Aditya. I build with the MERN stack and enjoy shipping small, useful tools.

On this blog I’ll share:
- short notes from projects
- practical web dev tips (Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB)
- occasional write‑ups about tooling and productivity

Thanks for reading! If you have feedback or ideas, reach out:
