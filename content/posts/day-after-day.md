It's an anniversary without Instagram. One reason I deactivated my account is that I felt I wasn't being true to myself. I know this sounds like influencer stuff, but it's the truth. Maybe I was pretending to be cooler or better than I am.

I remember after donating blood at a blood bank, I posted about it on Instagram. For the first time, I realized the purpose was overshadowed by the nuances of "Instagramification". Although I quickly archived the post, it stuck in my mind. When the time came, everything spiraled, and I deactivated my account.

On the other hand, when I donated during my short stay in Bangalore, I did it purely for the person in need. This time, I didn't think of it that way, and my friends don't even know about it. I think that's how it should beâ€”doing things from the heart without expecting anything in return. I felt genuinely good about it.

I believe I've achieved the objectives of deactivating Instagram. Now it's time to take a step forward.

Whoa... now that I can survive without Instagram, I'm deleting my account permanently. My life might look empty because it isn't shareable in the Instagram world. Just the same unsexy routine, day after day. I'm preferring the incremental way rather than waiting for the next big blip.

I'm hoping my long-term trajectory will be exceptional and look boring until suddenly it isn't. ðŸ¤ž
