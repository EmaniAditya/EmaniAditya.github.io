# My 100-Day (2025-12-19) Challenge 

Okay, the last few weeks I have been off-track. It's time I take things a little more seriously.

Yesterday, my father came and said, "[premove.app](https://premove.app/) won't work, I can't be sure my company uses this. You need to start focusing on other things as well." Like any other son, I have started focusing on other things ~~and do away with it~~ but won't be leaving it behind at this stage where it's half-baked.

So, the next 100 days are fully devoted to **turn the shit around of this project and bring it to a point where it doesn't need my assistance anymore** ðŸ¤ž
